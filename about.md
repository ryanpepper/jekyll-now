I'm a [PhD student at the University of Southampton](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/rp20g15/) in the Computational Modelling Group, and simulate magnetic systems through micromagnetism.

### Software

My work means that I do a lot of programming; this is a mixture between Python, Cython, C, C++, Tcl, Mathematica... and whatever else I need. I currently do a lot of work on the [FIDIMAG](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/fidimag) project. I've also done some work on the [Joommf](http://joommf.github.io/) project, which aims to bring a Python interface to the popular micromagnetic simulation software [OOMMF](http://math.nist.gov/oommf/), which ordinarily uses a Tcl interface. In the process of doing this work, I wrote a [kernel for the Tcl language for the Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ryanpepper/tcl_kernel). I've recently been playing around with writing a [C++ micromagnetic simulator](http://github.com/ryanpepper/cxxmag) for fun.
